term: "Exclusions"
---

Congress excluded from the FOIAâ€™s requirements three narrowly defined categories of law enforcement records where  publicly acknowledging the existence of the records could cause harm to law enforcement or national security interests.  The first exclusion protects against disclosure of a pending criminal law enforcement investigation where there is reason to believe that the target is unaware of the investigation and disclosure of its existence could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings. The second exclusion, which applies only to records maintained by criminal law enforcement agencies, protects against disclosure of unacknowledged, confidential informants. The third exclusion, which applies only to the FBI, protects against disclosure of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence, or international terrorism records, when the existence of those records is classified. Records falling within an exclusion are not subject to the requirements of the FOIA.
