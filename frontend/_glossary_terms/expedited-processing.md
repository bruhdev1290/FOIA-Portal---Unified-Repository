term: "Expedited processing"
---

Agencies generally process requests on a first-in, first-out basis.  Most agencies also utilize separate tracks to process simple and complex requests.  Under certain circumstances, your request may qualify for placement into a separate, expedited track where the agency will process it as soon as practicable.  The standards for expedited processing are set out in the FOIA and in the regulations of each federal agency.  Under the FOIA, a requester may qualify for expedited processing if they can demonstrate a “compelling need” for the records.  A “compelling need” can be shown  by:  (1) establishing that the  failure to obtain the records on an expedited basis “could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;” or, (2) if the requester is a “person primarily engaged in  disseminating information,” by demonstrating that there exists an “urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.”  Agencies may also establish additional standards for granting expedited processing, which they describe in their FOIA regulations.  Requesters must demonstrate how they meet one of the standards in order to have their request processed on an expedited basis.
