<p begin="00:00:00.0000764" end="00:00:04.684">After an agency receives your FOIA request, you will usually receive a letter   </p>
<p begin="00:00:04.684" end="00:00:08.269">acknowledging the request with an assigned tracking number.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:08.269" end="00:00:12.659">If the agency requires additional information before it can begin to process your request,   </p>
<p begin="00:00:12.659" end="00:00:14.671">it will contact you.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:14.671" end="00:00:18.154">The agency will typically search for records in response to your request   </p>
<p begin="00:00:18.154" end="00:00:20.431">and then review them to determine which records,   </p>
<p begin="00:00:20.431" end="00:00:23.617">or parts records, can be released to you.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:23.617" end="00:00:25.983">The agency will redact, or black out,   </p>
<p begin="00:00:25.983" end="00:00:30.987">any information protected from disclosure by one of the FOIA's nine exemptions.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:30.987" end="00:00:34.123">The releasable records will then be sent to you.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:34.123" end="00:00:39.042">You should always feel free to contact the agency if you have any questions about your request.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:39.042" end="00:00:42.967">The agency's FOIA staff is available to explain the FOIA process to you,   </p>
<p begin="00:00:42.967" end="00:00:46.184">to provide information about the status of your request,   </p>
<p begin="00:00:46.184" end="00:00:50.854">and to assist you in understanding how your request is being handled.   </p>
