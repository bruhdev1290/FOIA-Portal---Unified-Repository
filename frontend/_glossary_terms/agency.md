term: "Agency"
---

The FOIA applies to federal agencies, which are defined as any executive department, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including certain offices in the Executive Office of the President), or any independent regulatory agency.  The FOIA does not apply to the Judicial Branch (Courts) or the Legislative Branch (Congress).  It also does not apply to state and local governments.  Before making a request, itâ€™s important that you identify the correct agency where your request should be sent. The FOIA is administered on a decentralized basis, meaning each of over 100 agencies is responsible for receiving, processing, and responding to its own FOIA requests. The resources on this website are designed to assist you in this process.
