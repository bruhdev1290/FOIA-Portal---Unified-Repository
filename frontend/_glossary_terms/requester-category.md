For fee purposes, the FOIA separates requesters into three categories:  (1) commercial-use requesters; (2) representatives of the news media, non-commercial scientific institutions, and educational institutions; and (3) all other requesters.  Commercial-use requesters can be charged for search, review,  and duplication.  Representatives of the news media, non-commercial scientific institutions, and educational institutions are only charged for duplication, with the first 100 pages provided  at no charge.  All other requesters are charged for search time and duplication, with the first two hours of search time and 100 pages of duplication  provided at no charge.
