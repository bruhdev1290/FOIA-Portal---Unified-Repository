Records that agencies make publicly available without waiting for a specific FOIA request. Agencies post on their websites a vast amount of material concerning their functions and mission. The FOIA itself requires agencies to proactively post certain categories of information, including final opinions and orders, specific policy statements, certain administrative staff manuals, and frequently requested records.
