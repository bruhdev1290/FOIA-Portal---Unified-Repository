term: "Fee waiver"
---

Most FOIA requests do not involve any fees.  However, if an agency informs you that there are fees associated with your request, you may request a fee waiver under the standard provided in the FOIA.  You may request a fee waiver at any time during the processing of your request.  The agency will grant a fee waiver when disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.  Requests for fee waivers from individuals who are seeking records pertaining to themselves usually do not meet this standard.  Additionally, a requester's inability to pay fees is not a legal basis for granting a fee waiver.  When making a request for a fee waiver you must explain how your request meets the standard described above.
