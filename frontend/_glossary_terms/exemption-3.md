term: "Exemption 3"
---

Protects information specifically exempted from disclosure by another statute, if that statute either:  (1) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue; or (2) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.  An Exemption 3 statute must also cite specifically to subsection (b)(3) of the FOIA if enacted after October 28, 2009.
