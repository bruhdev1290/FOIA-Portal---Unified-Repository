<p begin="00:00:04.177" end="00:00:08.982">is a law that gives you the right to access information from the federal government.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:08.982" end="00:00:12.169">It is often described as the law that keeps citizens in the know    </p>
<p begin="00:00:12.169" end="00:00:14.521">about what their government is doing.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:14.521" end="00:00:18.610">Under the FOIA, agencies must release any information that is requested   </p>
<p begin="00:00:18.610" end="00:00:22.405">unless that information is protected from disclosure by law.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:22.405" end="00:00:26.881">The FOIA also requires that agencies automatically disclose certain information,   </p>
<p begin="00:00:26.881" end="00:00:29.844">including frequently requested records.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:29.844" end="00:00:33.433">As Congress, the President, and the Supreme Court have all recognized,   </p>
<p begin="00:00:33.433" end="00:00:36.964">the FOIA is a vital part of our democracy.   </p>
