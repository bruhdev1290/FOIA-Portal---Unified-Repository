term: "Multi-track processing"
---

A system that divides incoming FOIA requests according to their complexity so that simple requests requiring relatively minimal search and review are placed in one processing track and more complex requests are placed in one or more other tracks. Requests granted expedited processing are placed into their own track. Requests in each track are generally processed on a first in/first out basis.
