term: "Disclosability"

Prior to responding to your request, the agency will review the records to make disclosure decisions.  The FOIA provides broad access to agency records, but not all information is appropriate for disclosure.  Agencies will only withhold information that falls within one of the nine exemptions that protect for example, personal privacy and law enforcement interests. If information is withheld, the agency will identify the applicable exemption(s).
