<p begin="00:00:01.298" end="00:00:04.338">Since it was first passed in 1966, the FOIA has evolved   </p>
<p begin="00:00:04.338" end="00:00:07.724">through many Congressional amendments and judicial interpretations.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:07.724" end="00:00:10.829">It is the Executive Branch, led by the President,   </p>
<p begin="00:00:10.829" end="00:00:14.879">that is responsible for the administration of the FOIA across the government.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:14.879" end="00:00:17.337">So what's the President's policy?   </p>
<p begin="00:00:17.337" end="00:00:24.285">Simply put, President Obama has pledged to make this the most transparent Administration in history.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:24.285" end="00:00:29.552">In that spirit, Attorney General Eric Holder, the head of the Department of Justice,    </p>
<p begin="00:00:29.552" end="00:00:34.670">has directed agencies to apply a presumption of openness to every FOIA request.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:34.670" end="00:00:38.304">That standard favors disclosure whenever possible.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:38.304" end="00:00:43.010">The Attorney General also encouraged agencies to make more information available online,   </p>
<p begin="00:00:43.010" end="00:00:46.666">without the need for people to have to make FOIA requests.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:46.666" end="00:00:49.827">The Department of Justice's Office of Information Policy   </p>
<p begin="00:00:49.827" end="00:00:53.213">oversees agency compliance with these directives   </p>
<p begin="00:00:53.213" end="00:00:58.495">and encourages all agencies to fully comply with both the letter and the spirit of the FOIA -   </p>
<p begin="00:00:58.495" end="00:01:02.480">a spirit of transparency that makes our democracy unique.   </p>
<p begin="00:01:02.480" end="00:01:04.031">    </p>
