Agencies generally process requests on a first-in, first-out basis.  Most
agencies also use separate tracks to process simple and complex
requests.  Under certain circumstances, your request may qualify for
placement into a separate, expedited track where the agency will
process it as soon as practicable.  The standards for <span
data-term="expedited processing">expedited processing</span> are set
out in the FOIA and in the regulations of each federal agency.  Under the
FOIA, a requester may qualify for expedited processing if they can
demonstrate a <span data-term="compelling need">“compelling
need”</span> for the records.  A “compelling need” can be shown  by:  (1)
establishing that the  failure to obtain the records on an expedited
basis “could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the
life or physical safety of an individual;” or, (2) if the requester is a
“person primarily engaged in  disseminating information,” by
demonstrating that there exists an “urgency to inform the public
concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.”  Agencies may
also establish additional standards for granting expedited processing,
which they describe in their FOIA regulations.  Requesters must
demonstrate how they meet one of the standards in order to have their
request processed on an expedited basis.
