<p begin="00:00:05.195" end="00:00:07.421">Sometimes, an agency will be able to respond    </p>
<p begin="00:00:07.421" end="00:00:10.271">within the statuary time limit established by the FOIA,   </p>
<p begin="00:00:10.271" end="00:00:11.982">which is about a month.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:11.982" end="00:00:16.507">Although agencies make every effort to respond to FOIA requests as quickly as possible,   </p>
<p begin="00:00:16.507" end="00:00:20.585">in some cases they simply cannot do so within the time allotted.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:20.585" end="00:00:24.154">In this situation, the requests are considered "backlogged."   </p>
<p begin="00:00:24.154" end="00:00:28.254">The "backlog" data on FOIA.gov will show you how many requests were pending   </p>
