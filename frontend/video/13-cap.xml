<p begin="00:00:00.0000975" end="00:00:04.428">If you have questions about your request or are dissatisfied with the way it was handled -   </p>
<p begin="00:00:04.428" end="00:00:07.032">you have several options.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:07.032" end="00:00:10.722">First, you may contact the FOIA professional handling the request,   </p>
<p begin="00:00:10.722" end="00:00:13.913">or the FOIA contact provided by the agency.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:13.913" end="00:00:17.248">You may also contact the agency's FOIA Public Liaison   </p>
<p begin="00:00:17.248" end="00:00:19.798">who is there to explain the process to you,   </p>
<p begin="00:00:19.798" end="00:00:24.465">to assist in reducing any delays, and to help resolve any disputes.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:24.465" end="00:00:29.936">Often, a simple discussion between you and the agency will resolve any issues that may arise.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:29.936" end="00:00:32.786">Filing an appeal is also very simple.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:32.786" end="00:00:36.641">Typically, all you need to do is send a letter to the appellate authority   </p>
<p begin="00:00:36.641" end="00:00:40.736">stating that you are appealing the initial decision made on your request.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:40.736" end="00:00:43.241">There is no fee or cost involved.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:43.241" end="00:00:49.390">After an independent review, the appellate authority will send you a letter advising you of its decision.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:49.390" end="00:00:52.401">Once the administrative appeal process is complete,   </p>
<p begin="00:00:52.401" end="00:00:57.583">you also have the option to seek mediation services from the Office of Government Information Services   </p>
<p begin="00:00:57.583" end="00:01:00.837">at the National Archives and Records Administration.   </p>
<p begin="00:01:00.837" end="00:01:01.703">    </p>
