<p begin="00:00:03.189" end="00:00:08.101">but in certain instances, full FOIA processing may require a modest charge.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:08.101" end="00:00:11.849">Although there is usually no charge for the first two hours of search time   </p>
<p begin="00:00:11.849" end="00:00:15.122">and the first 100 pages of duplication,   </p>
<p begin="00:00:15.122" end="00:00:19.245">agencies typically can charge for the time it takes to search for records   </p>
<p begin="00:00:19.245" end="00:00:23.694">or for duplication of those records after the initial allotment runs out.   </p>

<p begin="00:00:34.976" end="00:00:37.899">Or you may request a waiver of fees.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:37.899" end="00:00:41.831">Fee waivers are limited to situations in which you can show that   </p>
<p begin="00:00:41.831" end="00:00:45.351">the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest.   </p>
<p begin="00:00:45.351" end="00:00:48.992">That means it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding   </p>
