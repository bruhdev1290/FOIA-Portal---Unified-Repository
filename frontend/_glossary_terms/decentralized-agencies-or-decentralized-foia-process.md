term: "Decentralized agencies or decentralized FOIA process"

When an agency is separated into components or offices that each receive and respond to FOIA requests for their own records, the FOIA process is called “decentralized.” Most large federal agencies have a decentralized FOIA process, where requesters send their requests directly to the component or office of the agency that maintains the records they seek, and that component handles the request.
