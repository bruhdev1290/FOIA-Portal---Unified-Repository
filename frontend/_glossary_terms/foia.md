Since 1967 the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/oip/legacy/2014/07/23/amended-foia-redlined-2010.pdf">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) has provided the public with access to federal agency records.   It is often described as the law that keeps citizens “in the know” about their government. The FOIA requires agencies to proactively post online certain categories of records and it provides the public with the right to request access to records from any federal agency.  For any record subject to the FOIA, federal agencies are required to disclose the record except to the extent that it contains information that is protected from disclosure by one of the FOIA’s nine exemptions that protect interests such as personal privacy, national security, and law enforcement.
