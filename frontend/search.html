<h2>Search Government Websites</h2>
<p>
	Agencies proactively post a wealth of information on their websites and in their FOIA Libraries. Before making a FOIA request, you may wish to conduct a search of agencies’ websites to see what is already publicly available online. The search feature below allows you to search across all government websites at once, to see what is already available without the need for a FOIA request.<br/><br/>

	If you do not find what you are looking for online, or if you want to request more information on a given topic, you can submit a FOIA request to the agencies’ Contacts.
